 # Report for the project

## individual contribution

Xiaoyang Xu (X454XU) is mainly responsible for the MainDecoder. I assigned the value to RegWrite_o, ImmSrc_o, ALUsrc_o, WriteSrc_o, ALUOp_o, MemWrite_o, Branch_o, Jump_o, Ret_o according to the indices from the book Digital Design and Computer Architecture by S. Harris & D. Harris. I did enconter difficulties while dealing with the U-type instructions. I solved this with the help from my teammate Constantin, and the solution is add extra bits to distinguish it from others.
