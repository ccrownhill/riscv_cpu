# Team Project Logbook

## Objectives

1. To learn RISC-V 32-bit integer instruction set architecture
2. To implememnt a single-cycle RV32I instruction set in a microarchitecture
3. To implemententing the F1 starting light algorithm in RV32I assembly language
4. To verify your RV32I design by executing the F1 light program
5. As stretched goal, to implement a simple pipelined version of the microarchitecutre with hazard detection and mitigation
6. As a further stretched goal, add data cache to the pipelined RV32I
