We successfully implemented the F1 light program as shown in the video linked below

We used a timer to record the time taken from 8 lights on to 8 lights off as illustrated in the table below:

Attempt | #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 | 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
Seconds | 3.95 | 4.61 | 5.89 | 5.10 |

The time interval from the current light on to the next light on is also a constant, and the value is about 1.43 seconds

These results mean that we successfully generated random numbers with LFSR.
